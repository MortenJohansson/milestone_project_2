## Morten Johansson || Simple map with searchbar

### Project Overview

This is my second milestone project for Code Institute's Full-stack Developer bootcamp.
This project required me to integrate javascript into my project.

My time for this project was poorly managed so I had to cut a good chunk of what I wanted to accomplish. More on that in the Scope section.
For this project I decided I wanted to make a travel site, with top locations to visit on your chosen destination. But due to time running out, it is now only a map with a searchbar that you can use to look around that area.
